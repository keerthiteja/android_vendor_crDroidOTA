crDroid 7.13 - December 2021 ASB release notes/known issues:
Changelog since cr7.11 official release - October ASB:
- Merged November ASB from upstream.
- Dropped a lot of optional kernel stuff in preparation for Android 12/crDroid 8 support. Long story short, there are a lot of things that are beyond the scope of my expertise to maintain, and go against the spirit of the official maintainer agreement for crDroid 8.0 going forward.
- Dropped DeviceExtras ("OnePlus Settings") in preparation for Android 12/crDroid 8 support.
What does that mean for you?
- Display modes are moved back to Settings > Display > LiveDisplay (which has a crap UI for it; putting up a modal dialog over a dimming layer over the preview image, instead of having a USEFUL preview image that's fully-visible as you make changes).
- No more vibration intensity sliders.It was half-broken anyway in OnePlus Settings.
- No more FPS counter overlay, boeffla wakelock blocker driver, USB2.0 fast charge current mod, superfluous I/O schedulers, overdriven audio gain, etc. Sorry, can't do much about that.
- If you want a well-tuned & tested kernel with lots of extra options, I recommend backing up the boot partition then flashing MCD kernel by @mcdachpappe, available at https://github.com/mcdachpappe/android_kernel_oneplus_sdm845/releases/. Use EXKM, FKM, or if you're broke, SmartPack Kernel Manager (free, available on F-Droid).
- Switched display panel handling entirely to work like OOS kernel, and incorporated commits from oneplus_sm8150-common to match (almost; couldn't move to oneplus_hardware version yet since we're not building vendor yet).
- Imported wifi stack from CAF tag LA.UM.9.3.r1-02800-sdm845.0, with modifications backported from MCD kernel to fix not being able to turn wifi radio back on in some edge cases & reduce logspam (delayed hdd initialization or something).
- Dropped SmartPixels feature (this has been half broken since Android 11 launch -- you can't operate controls in a view that's classified as a "secure setting" if a full-screen overlay is happening, which is exactly what SmartPixels is).
- Reverted "swipe up for face unlock" gesture requirement. You shouldn't use FaceUnlock for security; it's a convenience feature and makes your phone less secure. Now that you've been warned, I'll make it easier if you still insist on getting yourself in trouble. Will likely be dropped in crDroid 8 anyway (there's a very good reason Google dropped it from AOSP several versions ago).

At this point at the end of November I was ready to release crDroid v7.12, but there was an audio bug that was popping up for a small handful of both enchilada AND fajita users where no audio would be picked up/recorded by any mic when trying to record video or use speech recognition. Wasn't willing to put that out with such a show-stopper issue. That's why there was no official November release of cr7.12 pushed to OTA.
Turns out the issue was using Google Hotword Enrollment ("Hey Google"). As soon as folks disabled that, boom! Audio recording worked again everywhere.

Changelog continued (since v7.12, unreleased to OTA but available for testing in Telegram channel - come help test!):
- Merged December 2021 ASB from upstream.
- Reverted that "power: fg-gen3" kernel commit that was causing logspam for everyone (sorry DASH charger users, you won't get accurate time-until-full info... but if you cared about your battery, you wouldn't burn it with DASH charging anyway). If you want to just plug it in and be happy, please let me recommend using the built-in Smart Charging feature (or better yet, Advanced Charging Controller module for Magisk).
- Downgraded OnePlus Camera back to v2 again. The only way version 3 was working with our prebuilt vendor was with some ugly sepolicy haxx that I really can't justify (and required changes to some core ROM repositories that are beyond my area of responsibilty or capacity to maintain). I know the photo quality isn't quite as good, but really you should be using Google Camera for photo quality, and only use OnePlus Camera if you need 60fps video. Urnyx05, DMGC, Nikita, BSG, etc. all make truly excellent Google Camera ports that work well on OP 6 series.
- Much additional trimming & slimming & optimizing in preparation for source-built vendor and Android 12/crDroid 8 bringup.
- Attempting to bring in multiple vibration intensities again now that we've dropped "OnePlus Settings". They don't really work yet, but I have a custom HAL now based on android_hardware_oneplus (which we can't fully utilize yet since we're still on prebuilt vendor for now) that should get us closer.
- Using updated proprietary blobs imported from OxygenOS 11.1.2.2, and updated qcom-caf audio/display/media HALs with CAF tag LA.UM.9.3.r1-02800-sdm845.0 merged.
- Kernel now building with clang 14 from upstream.
- Fixed Night Light being wayyyy too orange, even at the least-intense setting. Check the github if you want the long explanation. TL;DR version: crDroid handles hardware color overlay transforms more accurately now (credit to kdrag0n/ProtonAOSP), but that exposed a bad default value that was being used for Night Light intensity color temperatures inherited from LineageOS.

Enchilada-specific:
- Nothing new specifically. But you were already perfect, weren't you? <3

Other known issues:
- Google Hotword recognition is kinda broken right now (on more than one custom ROM/device), and will cause some screw-up that prevents microphone audio from being allowed to go anywhere else if it's enabled.
- The "up vee" /\ screen-off gesture, left-to-right single finger swipe, and right-to-left single finger swipe screen-off gestures don't work (maybe?), all the other ones do. I don't know why. Sorry.
- You tell me!

Other stuff:
- I've taken on the impossible and am trying to do my own implementation of source-built vendor, because I have no idea how to interpret & duplicate what they've already done with Syberia (which is enchilada-only, anyway). By the time it actually WORKS, I'll probably be able to understand WTH they did there, but... that's kind of the point. Building vendor from source (so the ROM installer zip will flash the vendor partition as well as DTBO, System, and vbmeta as it does currently) will fix a lot of quirks/inconsistencies/limitations that we've been plagued with since the beginning of custom ROMs for OnePlus SDM845 (6/6T), and get us closer to feature parity with OP 7/8/9 series in being able to use android_hardware_oneplus repositories and be ready for a proper Android 12/crDroid 8 bringup.
It doesn't quite boot to the point I can get ADB access yet (hangs at "bootloader unlocked" warning screen), but it's doing SOMETHING and trying to mount internal storage via MTP, so we're not just dead in the water. fstab and QTI bootctrl seem to be doing the right things so far. Next step: go dig through stock init scripts & vendor props. If I can get ADB working again in stock recovery, I can get pstore/ramoops logs and be able to make real progress a lot faster.
